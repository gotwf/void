gotwf's miscellaneous voidlinux stuff - Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay!

If you're looking to install Voidlinux on a zfs root, grab the
.iso. In addition to zfs dkms, it also includes gptfdisk and
smartmontools packages.  

See my guide at http://www.teamcool.net/posts/zol-voidlinux.html for
one way of gettin-r-done.
